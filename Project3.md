# Project 3: Estimating Population of Cusco

## Overview
In this project, I applied two models, linear regression and random forest, to predict the population of Cusco, a level-1 subdivision of Peru. The original goal was to estimate the population for the whole country.

Actual population of Cusco: 1408049

Predicted population of linear regression: 1408218

Predicted population of random forest: 1408220

Surprisingly, the
