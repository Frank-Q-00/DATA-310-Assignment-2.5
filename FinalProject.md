# Data 310 Final Project: Trajectory Prediction Based on GPS Data 


## Problem Statement

**Initiative**
- GPS  data is critical in analyzing movements of individuals or groups of people in a certain area
- The prevalence of cellphone makes it easier to collect personal GPS data (many apps ask for access to your location when you’re using it)
- Decide to make use of the GPS data for predictions
- Due to the privacy concerns, I would start with my personal GPS data

<br>

**Goal**
- Based my historical GPS data with time (longitude, latitude, and time when I’m at the location), build a machine learning model that will predict my future movements (trajectories).
- Assess how the model can be improved in order to apply to a dataset with a large number of agents.
